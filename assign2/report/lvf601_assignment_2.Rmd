## Problem 1: [1.5 points]
Read the paper _Just-in-time transcription program in metabolic pathways_. Provide a summary of the paper structured as follows:
    
1. What was the problem/challenge addressed by the authors and why is it relevant?

2. What was their approach, i.e. how did they do what they did?

3. State the key take-home messages from their results, i.e., what did they find?


## Solution:

## Problem 2: [2.5 points]
Read Huang et al. 2007 paper _Bifurcation dynamics in lineage-commitment in bipotent progenitor cells_.

a. [1.5 points] Provide a succinct summary of the findings of the paper. Half a page would be perfect.

b. [1 point] Use phase portrait tools to reproduce figure 3D. Interpret the result and discuss why this behavior is relevant to developmental biology.

## Solution:
```{r}
include_graphics(here('assign2', 'img', 'phasePlot.png'))
```



## Problem 3: [1 point] 
Solve Exercise 7.5 (page 134) from Alon's book.
